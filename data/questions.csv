QEX8,Intermediate,Charts,"Which type of chart would best represent this data to highlight both the trend over time and the relative differences between quarters?","Line chart with markers. It clearly shows the trend over time and highlights quarter-to-quarter revenue differences.","text","","",300
QEX9,Advanced,Formulas,"Explain the logical steps and underlying mathematical principles required to calculate a monthly sales commission where 5% is applied only to the portion of exceeding $10,000.","Use a conditional check to determine if sales exceed $10,000, then multiply the excess by 5%, otherwise assign zero.","text","","",300
QEX10,Advanced,Analysis,"Why a pivot table is the preferred method, and how calculated fields could reveal deeper insights.","This layout (like a pivot table) enables easy comparison across regions and categories, and calculated fields can highlight additional patterns or profitability metrics.","text","","",300

QEX17,Intermediate,Validation,"Why is it important to implement rules that limit the type of information entered into specific data fields, such as restricting a Role field in an employee database to only a few predefined options?","Limiting entries in critical fields, like a Role field, ensures that only expected and consistent information is entered, which reduces errors and makes data analysis more reliable. Such controls help prevent typos, unauthorized values, and inconsistencies across records.","text","","",300
QEX18,Advanced,Financial,"A business is considering a new project and wants to determine its financial viability using the Net Present Value (NPV) method with a 10% discount rate. Describe the theoretical steps and reasoning needed to manually calculate the NPV for this project.","To calculate NPV, discount each future cash flow by dividing it by (1 + 0.10) raised to the period number, then sum these values and subtract the initial investment.This reflects the time value of money and helps determine if the project adds financial value.","text","","",300
QEX19,Intermediate,Text,"How do you combine text from two cells?","Use CONCATENATE function: =CONCATENATE(A1,B1) or ampersand: =A1&B1. In newer Excel, use CONCAT or TEXTJOIN functions.","text","","",150
QEX20,Advanced,Dashboard,"Why is using a consistent color scheme important in dashboard design, and how does it affect user interpretation?","A consistent color scheme enhances readability and ensures visual cohesiveness, making key data easier to identify.
